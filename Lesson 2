Data dimensions
	More complex/data dimensions == more challenging to design

Infographics vs Data visualization
	Infographics
		Manually drawn. Specific to data at hand. Aesthetically rich. Relatively data poor. Less control in changing the data.
	Data Visualization
		Algorithmically drawn. Easy to regenerate with different data. Often aesthetically barren. Relatively data-rich. 

	Point: Everytime that the data change, is it easily reflected through the design? 
		Yes: Data vis
		No: Info
